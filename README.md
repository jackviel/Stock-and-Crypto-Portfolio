# Stock-and-Crypto-Portfolio

Stock and Crypto Portfolio that compares the positions you own with the current price of the asset.

Works with both stocks and cryptocurrency using [this API](https://rapidapi.com/finance.yahoo.api/api/yahoo-finance-low-latency).

To use it just get your own api key from the link above and replace it in the code,
and also setup your positions in the positions.txt file in the order of SYMBOL NUMBER_OF_SHARES PRICE_WHEN_BOUGHT, example: GME 150 60, or BTC-USD 50 2000.
